getPlanets() may expose internal representation by returning Star.planets 
May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the 
  internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked 
  changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will 
  need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many 
  situations.

May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object 
Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the 
  internal representation of the object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked 
  changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will

new model.domain.SolarSystem(String, Star) may expose internal representation by storing an 
  externally mutable object into SolarSystem.sun 
May expose internal representation by incorporating reference to mutable object 
This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into the internal representation of the 
  object. If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object 
  would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. 
  Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.
